# MathMemo
Project Description


### Feature Wishlist
- [ ] Settings for image dimensions/resolution
- [ ] Default rendering colors
- [ ] Save settings
- [ ] double click to edit
- [ ] edit already committed formulas
- [ ] drag & drop to rearrange

### To Fix

- [ ] Edit preivous "committed" messsages

### Brainstorm Ideas

- [ ] block mode vs inline
- [ ] do we want to access the html? I'm not inclined to make this the default mode of operation.

- [ ] Optional vim bindings, maybe using fakevim
- [ ] LaTeX/Mathjax syntax highlighting
- [ ] Syntax completion
  - [ ] push one of the closing objets such as \right) ahead of the cursor.  we may not know the order, but when it gets typed, we can pull it out of the 'stack' ahead of the cursor. maybe offer it as a suggestion to complete as typing occurs in a pulldown thing
  - [ ] bad syntax delay/completeion record last good syntax and maybe don't process open {^_ until closed.  or maybe process it separately. maybe close it tenatively.  sth like a \dfrac could get two advanced {} ahead of it.  \dfrac... {} ...{}.  Hit tab/return to close it.
  - [ ] maybe add some kind of empty box after ^ and _ to indicate what is expected
- [ ] history
- [ ] save preferences/export colors/geometry
- [ ] toolbar for copy type shortcuts
- [ ] theming stuff / follow default theme / appropriate icon colors
- [ ] tabbed interface - multiple session 
- [ ] merge equations
- [ ] wizard for creating matrices or other elements
- [ ] collapse text elements between {}
- [ ] edit history
- [ ] autocompletion with candidate guessing
- [ ] macros / hot keys
- [ ] hide preview window when empty

- [ ] how do we tell if mathjax gave an error? .. one is yellow bg.
- [ ] drag equations between tabs/windows or within list position
- 	2 is.. $$?  maybe no svg generated?
- [ ] fix preview web view to scroll when eq gets large]
- [ ] When detecting syntax errors, we can incrementally process from left to right, inserting phantom closing delimiters.  maybe keep a histsory for speed.  or from the error state, we can back up one token/char at a time so that we can still display the last known good state but with an error indicator like a red background.   


### clean this up:

- We see yellow background syntax error on:
  - unappended ^ or _
  - no closing \right)
  - [ ] propose: adding a tenative {} to ^_
  - or tenative double {} to a frac/dfrac/tfrac

- $$ no process error:
  - unmatched {  or nothing after \
  - if we're editing in the middle? where do the tentatiive items go?
  - do we add the tentative closing } directly after? the cursor?
  - does it trail the cursor as we move?
  - should we maybe add	a red mark in the eq to show the location of the cursor? of what would be typed if we type something like maybe a red | or box?
  - if we add a mark, maybe only add it when there are open {} type things, otherwise what the user commit will be different than what gets displays

- what if you could highlight a potential block to surround with {}?
  - and when you highlight in the editor, it would show highlights in the formula as well.

- how about a tree structure that parses the things and shows where the cursor is in the tree..(or at least shows the cursor)

- \left. and \right.  seem to show nothing.. could be useful for syntax completion
- maybe show the phantom things as greyed out or some other color to note that they don't exist yet.
- and a red or gray cursor to show where the cursor is in the image equation.  \color{red}xxx seems useful, or {\color{red} |} is better

### minor bugs
- context menu action labels should be different
  - so do we use QAction instances to construct the menus? (currently done in init_action_dicts)
    - maybe setData to refer to the method & use that as an index
    - why not 'connect?', we need to associate it somehow.  before we iterated to check
    - 

- ### Completed Column âœ“
- [x] can copy image to clipboard and paste in an IM
- [x] draft mode with preview before commit
- [x] menubar, save dialogs, preferences
- [x] save a session
- [x] scrolling IM style widget 
- [x] scale down image in display as it gets larger
